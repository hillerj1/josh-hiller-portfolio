title: "PHY 310: Computational Physics Projects"
category: "Computational Physics"
summary: "Jupyter notebooks solving physics problems via numerical methods (bifurcation, chaos, finite differences, Monte Carlo)."
problem: "It was hard to compare accuracy and efficiency across numerical methods on real physics problems using only theory."
solution: "I built a reproducible notebook set that implements each method step-by-step with plots, error analysis, and side-by-side comparisons."

## Highlights
- Chaotic pendulum trajectories, bifurcation diagrams, FD eigenstates/wavefunctions.
- Monte Carlo minimization, Verlet/Euler integration, FFTs.
- Clear visualizations + notes for accuracy and performance tradeoffs.
