title: "PHY 310: Computational Physics Projects"
category: "Computational Physics"
summary: "Jupyter notebooks solving physics problems via numerical methods (bifurcation, chaos, finite differences, Monte Carlo)."
problem: "Coursework required implementing numerical methods from scratch and comparing their accuracy, stability, and performance on real physics problems (ODEs/PDEs, chaos, Monte Carlo). Raw theory alone didn’t reveal which methods or parameter choices worked best in practice."
solution: "Built a reproducible set of notebooks and utilities that implement each method step-by-step, run controlled experiments, visualize errors and stability regimes, and benchmark run time. Each notebook includes derivations, code, plots, and a short conclusion so results are comparable across problems."

## What I Did

- **ODE solvers (harmonic/anharmonic, driven/chaotic)**  
  Implemented explicit Euler, semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler, RK2/Heun, and **RK4**. Verified convergence by fitting
  the error model for RK4. Checked **energy drift** on Hamiltonian systems,
  showing symplectic Euler better preserves \(H(q,p)\) over long horizons.

- **Chaos & bifurcations**  
  Generated the **logistic-map** bifurcation diagram and estimated the Lyapunov exponent. Integrated the **Lorenz** system:
  $$
  \dot{x}=\sigma(y-x),\quad
  \dot{y}=x(\rho-z)-y,\quad
  \dot{z}=xy-\beta z
  $$
  and visualized the strange attractor + return maps.

- **Finite differences (PDE/eigenproblems)**  
  Discretized the 1D time-independent **Schrödinger** equation
  $$
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V(x)\psi=E\psi
  $$
  with 2nd-order central differences, forming a tri-diagonal system solved efficiently. For an infinite well of width, verified equation and node counts of eigenfunctions.

- **Spectral/FFT tools**  
  Used FFTs to analyze frequency content, compare spectral vs. FD resolution at equal grid sizes, and sanity-check
  Parseval-style energy consistency in time series.

- **Monte Carlo**  
  Implemented MC integration with **importance sampling**; confirmed error scaling on log–log plots and observed variance reductions on suitable test integrands.

- **Performance & correctness**  
  Vectorized inner loops with **NumPy**; profiled hotspots. Added lightweight checks (convergence orders, conservation laws)
  to prevent regressions.

- **Visualization & reporting**  
  Reusable Matplotlib helpers (phase portraits, bifurcations, error curves). Each notebook ends with **Takeaways** summarizing
  stable parameter ranges and method trade-offs.

## Methods & Experiments (Examples)

- **Pendulum / Mass–Spring (ODE)**  
  Small-angle model: $ \ddot{x} + \omega^2 x = 0 $.  
  Nonlinear pendulum:

  $$
  \ddot{\theta}+\frac{g}{\ell}\sin\theta=0,\qquad
  E=\tfrac12 m\ell^2\dot{\theta}^2 + m g \ell\,(1-\cos\theta).
  $$

  Step-size sweep $ h \in [10^{-4},\,10^{-1}] $: measured $ L^2 $ error vs. analytic solution; compared long-time energy behavior
  (RK4 baseline vs. symplectic Euler).

- **Lorenz Attractor (Chaos)**  
  Parameters $ \sigma=10,\ \rho=28,\ \beta=8/3 $. RK4 with adaptive-step trials; separation of nearby trajectories to visualize
  sensitivity; Poincaré/return maps.

- **Schrödinger (FD eigenproblem)**  
  Infinite well and finite barrier; verified second-order convergence by halving $ \Delta x $ and observing $\approx 4\times$ error reduction.

- **Monte Carlo Integration**  
  Estimated $ \pi $ and multi-D integrals; compared plain vs. importance sampling; confirmed $ \lVert \hat{I}-I \rVert \propto N^{-1/2} $.

## Results (Quick Snapshots)

- RK4 achieved **$ \sim\!\mathcal{O}(h^{4}) $**; symplectic Euler showed qualitatively superior long-time energy behavior.  
- FD eigenvalues matched analytics to **$<\!1\%$** at moderate grids; errors halved when $ \Delta x $ halved (2nd order).  
- MC variance improved **$ 2\!-\!3\times $** under importance sampling on selected integrands.
