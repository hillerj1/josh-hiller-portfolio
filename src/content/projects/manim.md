title: "Manim Visualizations for Physics & Math"
category: "Educational Visualization"
summary: "Programmatic animations using Manim to explain math/physics concepts through code-defined scenes."
problem: "Static diagrams donâ€™t convey dynamic phenomena well; editing animations by hand is slow and hard to reproduce."
solution: "I scripted Manim scenes so animations are reproducible, tweakable, and faithful to the underlying math."

## Highlights

- Labels/arrows to guide attention through each step of a derivation or concept.
- Easy to re-render at high resolution for presentations.
