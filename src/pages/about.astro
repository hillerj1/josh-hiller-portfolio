    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m Josh Hiller, a software engineer and physics student focused on quantum computing.
      I enjoy building robust software and exploring algorithms for near-term and future quantum devices.
      Recently I’ve worked with Qiskit, computational physics simulations, and programmatic visualizations with Manim.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m interested in roles that blend systems thinking with applied research—whether that’s developer tooling,
      simulation frameworks, or quantum applications.
